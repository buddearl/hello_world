Hello world repository

Hi, I am Nick and this is my first edit or anything rather on Git. I am determined to learn how to code and get a better job and life for myself and my family. I recenly has back surgery and will be having another shortly. I need to change careers from the blue collar field I have always worked in to a more white collar job. I want this to save my back, be part of something larger than manufacturing and create a better life for my family.
